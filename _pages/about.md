I'm a 4th-year PhD student in Computer Science at UCLA. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Aditya Grover](https://aditya-grover.github.io/). 

My primary research interest lies in endowing machines with human-like reasoning and efficiency. My recent research focuses on:

- Understanding and scaling (diffusion) LLM reasoning via RL — [d1](https://x.com/siyan_zhao/status/1910814716869710229), [IGPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10396), and [probing in-context learning](https://x.com/siyan_zhao/status/1805277462890492321).
- Efficient preference alignment & personalization — [GPO](https://siyan-zhao.github.io/llm-gpo/), [PrefEval](https://prefeval.github.io/).
- LLM inference efficiency & modular design for RL — [Prepacking](https://x.com/siyan_zhao/status/1780288750624612850), [Decision Stacks](https://siyan-zhao.github.io/decision-stacks/).

Prior to UCLA, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the Engineering Science (Machine Intelligence program) at the University of Toronto. Before my PhD, I worked on 3D perception and RL algorithms for autonomous driving agents.
